# Snake-Game
This repository contains a classic Snake game developed using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features simple yet engaging mechanics, including:

**Snake Movement:** The snake moves smoothly in response to keyboard controls (arrow keys).

**Food Collection:** The snake grows longer each time it collects food, with the player's score increasing accordingly.

**Collision Detection:** The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the screen boundaries.

The project applies object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage the snake's behavior and interactions, ensuring efficient and modular code structure. It's a fun and straightforward implementation, ideal for practicing Python and game development skills!
